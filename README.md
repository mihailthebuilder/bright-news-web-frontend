## Architecture

The frontend is a React SPA that sits on a [different repo](https://github.com/mihailthebuilder/bright-news-web-frontend) and is hosted with GitHub Pages.

I decided to keep it separate from the back-end because I felt it would create unnecessary complexity. Django pushes a server-side rendering approach, with HTML components delivered independently one of the other. This is more ideal for sites that deliver a lot of content.

However, the client-side is very light on content that's not generated by the scoring algorithm. I also have completely different sections in the HTML interacting with each other.

## Pages

The SPA is made up of 3 "pages":

- Landing - simple page where you input the website you wish to analyse
- Results - shows the results of the analysis
- About - explains this project

The same URL is being used across all 3; the `page` state in `App.js` decides which page to show. I did consider using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) in order to have the URL appropriate reflect the page. The downside was that I would've had to build rules for when someone directly accesses the Results page URL.

The `Footer` component is reused across the 3 pages in exactly the same shape. The header (`NavBar`) component is also reused, but with a twist: when the user goes to the Results or About pages, a smaller search bar will be sent to `NavBar` as a child component. This search bar is another instance of the same `SearchBar` component as the one on the Landing page.

## Running the analysis

After you input the site's URL and click the Analyse button, the `getUrlResults` function gets triggered. The function first sets the `loadingSearch` state to `true` in order to show a loading spinner on the button. It then calls the backend API using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to retrieve the results. 2 things can happen afterwards:

1. If the results are invalid, an error message is shown for 3 seconds via the `ErrorMessage` component.
2. If the results are valid, you get shown the Results page with the data fetched from the API.

You may notice that I do a ton of data manipulation in the components for the Results page - `ResultsDetails`, `ScoreGroup` and `ScoreDetails`. You might then wonder why I don't do it on the backend; Python would be amazing for that right? The reason - I wanted to reduce latency, as well as the computational burden since I'm on a free Heroku tier ðŸ˜…

## Mobile responsive

Wouldn't have it any other way ðŸ“±ðŸ”¥
